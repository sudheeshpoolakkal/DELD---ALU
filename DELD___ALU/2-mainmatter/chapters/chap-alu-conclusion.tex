\subsection{Additional Operations}
Add more advanced operations such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shift operations (logical and arithmetic)
    \item Rotate operations (left and right)
    \item Comparison operations (greater than, less than, equal)
    \item Increment and decrement operations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Status Flags}
Integrate comprehensive status flags:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Carry flag for arithmetic overflow
    \item Zero flag for null results

    \item Minimize propagation delays through careful layout
    \item Implement parallel multiplication algorithms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PCB Design}
Create a printed circuit board for permanent, reliable implementation:
