All circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and schematics presented in this report are original work created by the project team or properly attributed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Circuit diagrams and block diagrams were designed using standard digital logic design principles and textbook references cited in the bibliography.

\item Simulation screenshots were captured from Proteus Design Suite software used for circuit validation.

\item All IC datasheets referenced are publicly available technical documents from semiconductor manufacturers (Texas Instruments, etc.) and are cited in the references section.

\item The project implementation is based on fundamental digital electronics concepts taught in the curriculum and does not infringe on any proprietary designs.
\end{enumerate}

This project report represents our independent work under the guidance of our project supervisor and uses only publicly available educational resources and standard components.
