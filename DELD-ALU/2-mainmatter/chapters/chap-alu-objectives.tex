\chapter{Objectives}

The main objectives of this project are outlined below:

\section{Design and Implementation}

To successfully design and construct a functional 4-bit ALU using fundamental digital components, including basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and flip-flops (for control and state).

\section{Operational Capability}

To ensure the implemented ALU is capable of performing a defined set of fundamental operations, which must include:

\subsection{Arithmetic Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition of two 4-bit binary numbers
    \item Subtraction using two's complement method
    \item Multiplication of 4-bit operands
    \item Division of 4-bit numbers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logical Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bitwise AND operation
    \item Bitwise OR operation
    \item Bitwise XOR operation
\end{itemize}

\section{Demonstrate Working Principle}

To demonstrate the practical working of an ALU by showing how it manipulates 4-bit data inputs according to a control signal that selects the desired operation.

\section{Educational Outcome}

To enhance the understanding of digital logic design principles and showcase the internal architecture of complex data manipulation circuits, thereby providing a foundational understanding of CPU operation.
